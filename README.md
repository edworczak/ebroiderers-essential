# embroiderer-essential

I want this app to be embroiderer's best friend. I'm a fellow embroiderer and found a need to keep all my info in one place. Current plan is to include features:
* My projects
  * Timer
* My thread palettes
* Shopping list
  * Adding thread colours from thread collection, basic embroidery supplies and input for user's text
* Thread collection checklist
* Thread colours substitutes (you can find demo [here](https://edworczak.github.io/embroiderer-essential/))
* Utility pages
  * Settings
  * Help
  * Profile
  * Search

If you have any ideas on your own raise them in [Issues](https://github.com/edworczak/ebroiderers-essential/issues) section. If you speak Polish join our handcraft Discord server [Koło Gospodyń Internetowych](https://discord.gg/HqNVstmPDV).
